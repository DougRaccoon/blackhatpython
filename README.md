# Black Hat Python scripts and more!
Howdy to anyone who stumbled upon this. Here is a place to hone my python tool creation ability. Most of the scripts you will find here are from the Black Hat Python book, though I will be making my own tools for personal use. Each chapter has its own theme for the tools created within, below you can see those chapters.
