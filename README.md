# Black Hat Python scripts and more!
Howdy to anyone who finds themselves here. This is a place to hone my python tool creation ability. Most of the scripts you will find here are from the Black Hat Python book, though I will be making my own tools for personal use. Each chapter has its own theme for the tools created within, below you can see those chapters. My personal tools I will be sure to comment and explain what is happening, but the Black Hat Python (shortened to BHP for convenience) scripts will be raw code with little explanation as the book goes in depth as to what each script does.
